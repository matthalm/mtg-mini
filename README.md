# mtg-mini
There are too many random MTG sets, with too many versions. This page just lists expansions and core sets, with links to Scryfall searches for cards in boosters.

This is more useful/necessary for sets since Throne of Eldraine, but all are included here for completeness.

SVG data obtained from Scryfall. Alpha/Beta/Unlimited/Revised use set images from draftsim.com.
